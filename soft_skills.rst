What is the role of ops?
========================
Under any of the ops professions, the most fundamental role of the ops 
person is to deliver services to a set of customers. To build upon this
the ops person maintains existing IT infrastructures, translates
customer requirements into tangible and actionable solutions, assists
in the protection of customer information and services, and advises
stakeholders on application of technology under existing limitations
of time, money, or capabilities.

Maintaining Existing IT Infrastructures
---------------------------------------

The most visible role of Ops is to maintain the status quo. For the
system administrator this means maintaining servers and processes such
as logging, monitoring, backups, authentication, or naming services.
For the network administrator it means maintaining routers, switches,
the edge network, gateways, or the relationship with the corporate
Internet Service Provider (ISP). A security engineer might be
responsible for maintaining a vulnerability scanning capability,
incident response policy and processes, intrusion detection systems,
firewalls, and a customer security awareness training program. These
roles are distinct but there is sometimes overlap between them in
smaller organizations where fewer people server in multiple roles.

Translating Customer Requirements
---------------------------------
Ops roles are customer service positions. These careers require a level
of customer interaction because the services delivered by the Ops
professional must be driven by customer needs. In this case, customer is
used to mean the business, organization, or other entity that is
employing the Ops professional. Some questions to ask to help the Ops
person understand requirements from the customer perspective:

* What is the core mission of this organization?
* How does Ops support the mission?
* What does the organization need from the Ops professionals?
* Why should this organization come to these Ops people for this service
* or solution? (What is the value proposition for Ops within this organization?)
* How could Ops provide more value: higher level of competitiveness, faster service delivery, stronger security, or other benefit that aligns with the mission?

Translating customer requirements is key to focusing the efforts of Ops.
Ops work can be a slippery slope where the professionals are spreading
themselves too thin on projects and deliverables that do not serve the
organizations mission. One way to focus the efforts of Ops is to answer
these questions and to ensure that the Ops organization, whether
insourced or outsourced, is delivering services that provide the most value.

Protection of Information and Services
--------------------------------------

Often the Ops professionals in an organization are the people who most
completely understand the technical risk to organizational assets from
an IT perspective. Senior management within an organization will usually
understand financial risks, risks from competition, manufacturing risks,
etc. but they often do not understand IT risks because of the deep-dive
technical expertise required to comprehend threats to the organization.

This is another area where the Ops professional is communicating with
the organization's leaders to advise on appropriate actions to reduce
risk where it makes sense for the organization. 

Examples of areas where organizations need the Ops professional to plan
around risks could include threats to data from internal and external sources, 
hardware failure, site availability or reslience, data preservation, and
information integrity. Again, these areas are dependent on the
organization's mission. 

For example: an ecommerce organization will most likely want strong
site availability and protection of customer personal information.
The Ops professionals might build a site with high reslience and
availability including use of Content Delivery Networks (CDNs),
strong encryption not only for the ecommerce session but also data
at rest, role-based access for internal employees accessing customer
information to reduce access to only those people who need access
to that information.  Organizational leaders often do not understand
how these solutions are implemented so it is up to the Ops professional
to communicate the threat, solution, cost, impact to the organization
of implementing the solution.

Advising within Current Limitations
-----------------------------------

The Ops professional who advises an organization must also consider
limitations that impact the potential solution. Cost, timing, expertise
within the organization, available time of the people who would
implement the solution,or IT security issues may be considerations.
For example, decision makers within the organization will need to
know what is possible and for what cost so they can make the decision
how to spend the organization's money.  Good, fast, or cheap (pick two):
it may be the Ops professional's responsibility to explain this concept
from an IT perspective.

The importance of Documentation
===============================

What to document
----------------

* Runbooks? SOP? (cparedes: might be worthwhile even though we want to automate
  SOP’s away as much as possible - what should we check at 2 AM? What do folks
  typically do in this situation if automation fails?)

* Architecture and design (cparedes: also maybe talk about *why* we choose that
  design - what problems did we try to solve? Why is this a good solution?) How
  to manage documentation

Documentation through Diagrams

Project Management (Does time management go here too?)
